- **`workflow_consolidation_strategy.md`** - Strategy to consolidate from 13 workflows to 4 essential workflows

#### `/architecture/repository_splitting/`
- **`repository_split_architecture.md`** - Microservice decomposition strategy for stable sister-agent coordination

### `/dependencies/`
Dependency analysis and impact assessments.

- **`vdvil_dependency_impact_analysis.md`** - Analysis of VDVIL subproject dependencies and architectural impact

## Key Architectural Insights

### The Foundation Problem
The current Komposteur architecture suffers from **technical debt crisis** where features are added faster than the architectural foundation can support them. This creates:

- **CI/CD workflow explosion** (13 workflows causing maintenance nightmare)
- **Circular dependency hell** (Maven reactor build failures)
- **Cross-repository authentication complexity** (sister-agent coordination failures)

### Sister-Agent Coordination Vision
The hierarchical multi-agent system concept is architecturally sound:
```
YOLO Master Orchestrator
├── Komposteur Subagent (beat-sync, S3, Java ecosystem)
└── VideoRenderer Subagent (FFmpeg optimization, crossfade processing)
```

However, successful implementation requires **stable foundations first**.

### Recommended Architecture Path

1. **CI/CD Consolidation**: 13 workflows → 4 essential workflows
2. **Repository Split**: Monolithic → microservice decomposition  
3. **Dependency Management**: VDVIL risk mitigation
4. **Foundation Stability**: 95%+ CI success rate before feature work

## Implementation Priority

```
Priority 1: Architecture before Features
Priority 2: Stability before Performance  
Priority 3: Sister-Agent Coordination on Stable Foundations
```

The documentation in this directory provides concrete strategies for achieving these architectural improvements while maintaining the vision of effective hierarchical multi-agent video processing coordination.
