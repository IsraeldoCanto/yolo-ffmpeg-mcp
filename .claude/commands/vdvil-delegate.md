## Delegation Process

### 1. Audio Task Analysis
YOLO master agent automatically:
- Identifies DJ-mixing, composition, or audio infrastructure requirements
- Analyzes audio quality and performance needs
- Determines VDVIL subagent expertise requirements
- Prepares delegation with audio specifications and coordination needs

### 2. Specialized Audio Processing
VDVIL subagent:
- Applies DJ-mixing expertise and audio composition knowledge
- Processes audio using VDVIL infrastructure and rendering engine
- Implements audio optimization and quality enhancement
- Coordinates with sister subagents for integrated workflows

### 3. High-Quality Audio Results
Delivers to YOLO master:
- Professional-quality mixed audio with optimal transitions
- Validated composition data and audio timeline information
- Performance-optimized audio processing with quality metrics
- Integration-ready outputs for video processing workflows

## Response Format

After delegation, YOLO master receives structured response:

## Common Usage Patterns

### Music Video Audio Creation
```bash
# YOLO Master coordinates audio creation for music videos
User Request: "Create background audio mix for music video"
↓
YOLO Analysis: Audio mixing (VDVIL) + beat-sync (Komposteur) + video sync (VideoRenderer)
↓
/vdvil "Create professional DJ mix with crossfading for music video background"
↓
Komposteur processes beat synchronization using VDVIL output
↓
VideoRenderer synchronizes video with beat-synchronized audio
↓
YOLO assembles final music video with professional audio
```

### Audio Infrastructure Enhancement
```bash
# YOLO Master delegates audio infrastructure optimization
User Request: "Improve audio processing performance for video workflows"
↓
YOLO Analysis: Audio infrastructure (VDVIL) + video performance (VideoRenderer)
↓
/vdvil "Optimize audio rendering pipeline and binding layer performance"
↓
VideoRenderer benefits from improved audio processing capabilities
↓
YOLO reports unified performance improvements across audio-video pipeline
```

### Composition Processing Workflow
```bash
# YOLO Master handles composition processing and integration
User Request: "Process uploaded audio composition for video project"
↓
YOLO Analysis: Composition processing (VDVIL) + timeline integration (Komposteur)
↓
/vdvil "Validate and process audio composition, generate timeline data"
↓
Komposteur uses composition timeline for beat-synchronized video creation
↓
YOLO coordinates final video assembly with processed audio
```

  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Delegation
- **Specify Audio Requirements**: Include quality targets, format preferences, timing constraints
- **Provide Context**: Mention integration needs with video processing workflows
- **Set Performance Expectations**: Indicate real-time vs batch processing requirements
- **Consider Coordination**: Specify sister subagent dependencies and handoff requirements

### Optimal Task Descriptions
```bash
# Good: Specific with quality and performance targets
/vdvil "Create 5-track DJ mix with professional crossfading, 48kHz quality for video sync"

# Good: Clear composition processing requirements
/vdvil "Validate XML composition structure and convert to JSON with timeline generation"

# Less ideal: Vague requirements
/vdvil "Make audio better"
```
